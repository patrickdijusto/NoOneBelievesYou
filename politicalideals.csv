"Justice can never be secured by any system of unrestrained force exercised by interested parties in their own interests."
"The tyranny of the employer, which robs the greater part of most men's lives of liberty and initiative, is unavoidable so long as the employer retains the right of dismissal with loss of pay."
"As people grow more civilized, incentives based on hope become increasingly preferable to those that are based on fear."
"It would be far better that people should be rewarded for working well than that they should be punished for working badly."
"Sufficient pay to ensure a livelihood ought to be given to every person who is willing to work, independently of the question whether the particular work at which he is skilled is wanted at the moment or not."
"Why, for example, should a cab driver be allowed to suffer on account of the introduction of taxies? He has not committed any crime, and the fact that their work is no longer wanted is due to causes entirely outside their control."
"Industrial changes tend to cause hardships to some section of wage-earners, so there is a tendency to technical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations, new processes, and new methods."
"The instinctive conservatism of mankind is sure to make all processes of production change more slowly than they should."
"It will be said that people will not work well if the fear of dismissal does not spur them on. I think it is only a small percentage of whom this would be true at present."
"To very many, security would bring a quite new possibility of physical and moral health."
"The most dangerous aspect of the tyranny of the employer is the power which it gives them of interfering with men's activities outside their working hours."
"I think there is danger in the attempt to use the machinery of the present capitalist state for socialistic purposes."
"A man's pay should not cease through the accident of their work being no longer needed, but should continue so long as he is willing to work, a new trade being taught them at the public expense, if necessary."
"Unwillingness to work should be treated medically or educationally, when it could not be overcome by a change to some more congenial occupation."
"The workers in a given industry should all be combined in one autonomous unit, and their work should not be subject to any outside control."
"Love of drama is a great enemy of true vision."
"Vital and radical reform requires some vision beyond the immediate future, some realization of what human beings might make of human life if they chose."
"Without hope, people will not have the energy and enthusiasm necessary to overcome opposition, or the steadfastness to persist when their aims are for the moment unpopular."
"Every person who has really sincere desire for any great amelioration in the conditions of life has first to face ridicule, then persecution, then cajolery and attempts at subtle corruption."
"Economic systems are concerned essentially with the production and distribution of material goods. Our present system is wasteful on the production side, and unjust on the side of distribution."
"The production of the necessaries of existence should be a preliminary to the important and interesting part of life, except for those who find a pleasure in some part of the work of producing necessaries."
"It is not in the least necessary that economic needs should dominate person as they do at present."
"Private ownership of land and capital is not defensible on grounds of justice, or on the ground that it is an economical way of producing what the community needs."
"It is perfectly possible to proceed step by step towards economic freedom and industrial self-government."
"The difficulty is inspiring people with hope, of giving them enough imagination to see that the evils from which they suffer are unnecessary, and enough thought to understand how the evils are to be cured."
"Revolutionary action may be unnecessary, but revolutionary thought is indispensable, and, as the outcome of thought, a rational and constructive hope."
"Under state socialism, where the State is the only employer, there is no refuge from its prejudices such as may now accidentally arise through the differing opinions of different men."
"The State would be able to enforce any system of beliefs it happened to like, and it is almost certain that it would do so. Freedom of thought would be penalized, and all independence of spirit would die out."
"Minorities must be able to live and develop their opinions freely."
"No one ought to be allowed to suffer destitution so long as he or she is _willing_ to work."
"It would be possible now, if we had a wise economic system, for all who have needs to find satisfaction for them."
"By a few hours a day of manual work, a person can produce as much as is necessary for their own subsistence; that is all that the community has a right to demand of him."
"It ought to be open to all who so desire to do short hours of work for little pay, and devote their leisure to whatever pursuit happens to attract them."
"And there would always be a minority who would give their hours of leisure to science or art or literature, or some other pursuit out of which fundamental progress may come."
"Except in cases of unusual laziness or eccentric ambition, most people would elect to do a full day's work for a full day's pay."
"Work should, as far as possible, afford interest and independence and scope for initiative. These things are more important than income, as soon as a certain minimum has been reached."
"Good political institutions should weaken, not strengthen, the impulse toward force and domination."
"Economic injustice is perhaps the most obvious evil of our present system."
"Force should only be used against those who attempt to use force against others, or against those who will not respect the law in cases where a common decision is necessary and a minority are opposed to the action of the majority."
"There is probably one purpose, and only one, for which the use of force by a government is beneficent, and that is to diminish the total amount of force in the world."
"The economic system we wish to see is one in which the state is the sole recipient of economic rent, while capitalist enterprises should be replaced by self-governing combinations of those who actually do the work."
"In dark days, men need a clear faith and a well-grounded hope; and as the outcome of these, the calm courage which takes no account of hardships by the way.""In every walk of life, independence of mind is punished by failure, more and more as economic organizations grow larger and more rigid." 
"Fear of destitution is not a motive out of which a free creative life can grow, yet it is the chief motive which inspires the daily work of most wage-earners.""The world is full of preventible evils which most people would be glad to see prevented. Nevertheless, these evils persist, and nothing effective is done toward abolishing them."
"War is recognized as an evil by an immense majority in every civilized country; but this recognition does not prevent war."
"The unjust distribution of wealth must be obviously an evil to those who are not prosperous, and they are nine tenths of the population. Nevertheless it continues unabated."
"The tyranny of the holders of power is a source of needless suffering and misfortune to very large sections of mankind; but power remains in few hands, and tends, if anything, to grow more concentrated."
"The system which cannot save mankind from such an appalling disaster is at fault somewhere, and cannot be amended in any lasting way unless the danger of great wars in the future can be made very small."
"From the highest to the lowest, almost all people are absorbed in the economic struggle: the struggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their due."
"Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative impulses."
"Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering."
"Institutions which will diminish the sway of greed are possible, but only through a complete reconstruction of our whole economic system."
"We need a system which will hold in check men's predatory impulses, and will diminish the economic injustice that allows some to be rich in idleness while others are poor in spite of unremitting labor."
"Above all we need a system which will destroy the tyranny of the employer, by making people secure against destitution and able to find scope for individual initiative in the industry by which they live."
"State socialism, though it might give material security and more justice than we have at present, would probably fail to liberate creative impulses or produce a progressive society."
"Vast tracts of Africa become recruiting grounds for the labor required in the gold and diamond mines; for this purpose, the population is demoralized, taxed, and driven into revolt."
"Healthy and vigorous races from Southern Europe are tempted to America, where sweating and slum life reduce their vitality if they do not actually cause their death."
"The mines, forests, and wheat-fields of the world are all being exploited at a rate which must practically exhaust them at no distant date."
"The world is living too fast; in a kind of delirium, almost all the energy of the world has rushed into the immediate production of something, no matter what, and no matter at what cost."
"Among the many obvious evils of the wage system, none are more glaring than that it encourages predatory instincts, allows economic injustice, and that give great scope to the tyranny of the employer."
"As to predatory instincts, we may say, broadly speaking, that in a state of nature there would be two ways of acquiring riches--one by production, the other by robbery."
"Under our existing system, there are many ways of becoming rich without contributing anything to the wealth of the community."
"Although most people have to produce in order to live, a privileged minority are able to live in luxury without producing anything at all."
"It is not by means of useful action which increases the general wealth of the community that people amass fortunes; it is much more often by skill in exploiting or circumventing others."
"It would be utterly absurd to maintain that the people who inherit great wealth deserve better of the community than those who have to work for their living."
"I am not prepared to maintain that economic justice requires an exactly equal income for everybody. Some kinds of work require a larger income for efficiency than others do."
"There is economic injustice as soon as a person has more than his share, unless it is because their efficiency in their work requires it, or as a reward for some definite service."
"The modern growth of monopolies in the shape of trusts, cartels, federations of employers and so on has greatly increased the power of the capitalist to levy toll on the community."
 
"The hope of possessing more wealth and power than any person ought to have, which is the corresponding motive of the rich, compels people to close their minds against justice."
"The hope of possessing more wealth and power than any person ought to have, which is the corresponding motive of the rich, compels people to prevent themselves from thinking honestly on social questions."
"The injustices of destitution and wealth alike ought to be rendered impossible." 
"Security and liberty are only the negative conditions for good political institutions." 
"Security demands creativeness as its counterpart, in order to keep alive the adventure and interest of life, and the movement toward perpetually new and better things." 
"There can be no final goal for human institutions; the best are those that most encourage progress toward others still better." 
"Without effort and change, human life cannot remain good." 
"It is not a finished Utopia that we ought to desire, but a world where imagination and hope are alive and active." 
"It is a sad evidence of the weariness mankind has suffered from excessive toil that their heavens have usually been places where nothing ever happened or changed." 
"Fatigue produces the illusion that only rest is needed for happiness; but when people have rested for a time, boredom drives them to renewed activity." 
"A useful life ought to be as far as possible creative, not merely predatory or defensive." 
"Creative activity requires imagination and originality, which are apt to be subversive of the _status quo_." 
"At present, those who have power dread a disturbance of the _status quo_, lest their unjust privileges should be taken away." 
"In combination with the instinct for conventionality, those who profit by the existing order have established a system which punishes originality and starves imagination." 
"The whole spirit in which education is conducted needs to be changed, in order that children may be encouraged to think and feel for themselves, not to acquiesce passively in the thoughts and feelings of others." 
"It is not rewards after the event that will produce initiative, but a certain mental atmosphere." 
"The tyranny of vast machine-like organizations, governed from by people who care little for the lives they control, is killing individuality and freedom of mind, forcing people to conform to a uniform pattern.""There can be no real freedom or democracy until the people who do the work in a business also control its management." 
"A modern state is so vast and its machinery is so little understood that even when a person has a vote he does not feel himself any effective part of the force which determines its policy." 
"By a share in the control of smaller bodies, a person might regain some of that sense of personal opportunity and responsibility which belonged to the citizen of a city-state in ancient Greece or medieval Italy." 
"Liberty demands self-government, but not the right to interfere with others." 
"The greatest degree of liberty is not secured by anarchy." 
"The reconciliation of liberty with government is a difficult problem, but it is one which any political theory must face." 
"The essence of government is the use of force in accordance with law to secure certain ends which the holders of power consider desirable." 
"The coercion of an individual or a group by force is always in itself more or less harmful." 
"If there were no government, the result would not be an absence of force in men's relations to each other; it would merely be the exercise of force by those who had strong predatory instincts."
"The results of anarchy between states should suffice to persuade us that anarchism has no solution to offer for the evils of the world." 
"No one would maintain that parents should have unlimited freedom to ill-treat their children." 
"So long as some wish to do violence to others, there cannot be complete liberty, for either the wish to do violence must be restrained, or the victims must be left to suffer." 
"Although individuals and societies should have the utmost freedom as regards their own affairs, they ought not to have complete freedom as regards their dealings with others." 
"To give freedom to the strong to oppress the weak is not the way to secure the greatest possible amount of freedom in the world." 
"Democracy is a device--the best so far invented--for diminishing as much as possible the interference of governments with liberty." 
"If a nation is divided into two sections which cannot both have their way, democracy theoretically insures that the majority shall have their way."
"But democracy is not at all an adequate device unless it is accompanied by a very great amount of devolution." 
"Love of uniformity, or the mere pleasure of interfering, or dislike of differing tastes and temperaments, may often lead a majority to control a minority in matters which do not really concern the majority." 
"Force should only be used against those who attempt to use force against others, or against those who will not respect the law."
"Most of us abstain from theft, not because it is illegal, but because we feel no desire to steal." 
"The more people learn to live creatively rather than possessively, the less their wishes will lead them to thwart others or to attempt violent interference with their liberty." 
"In proportion as people live creatively, they cease to wish to interfere with others by force." 
"Very many matters in which, at present, common action is thought indispensable, might well be left to individual decision." 
"It used to be thought absolutely necessary that all the inhabitants of a country should have the same religion, but we now know that there is no such necessity." 
"It will be found, as people grow more tolerant in their instincts, that many societal uniformities now insisted upon are useless and even harmful." 
"Vast organizations are an inevitable element in modern life, and it is useless to aim at their abolition."  
"We see the things we had thought evil are really evil, and we know more definitely the directions in which we must move if a better world is to arise on the ruins of the one which is hurling itself into destruction."
"We see that men's political dealings with one another are based on wholly wrong ideals, and can only be saved by quite different ideals from continuing to be a source of suffering, devastation, and sin."
"The possessive impulses, when they are strong, infect activities which ought to be purely creative."
"Every creative impulse is shadowed by a possessive impulse; even the aspirant to saintliness may be jealous of the more successful saint."
"Most affection is accompanied by some tinge of jealousy, which is a possessive impulse intruding into the creative region."
"The worst aspect of the possessive impulse is the sheer envy of those who have missed everything worth having in life, and who are instinctively bent on preventing others from enjoying what they have not had."
"One can hinder growth by applying any kind of force, whether discipline or authority or fear or the tyranny of public opinion."
"Those who realize the harm that can be done by any use of force, and the worthlessness of the goods that can be acquired by force, will be very full of respect for the liberty of others."
"Those who realize the harm that can be done by any use of force will treat every human being with a kind of tenderness, because the principle of good 
is fragile and infinitely precious."
"Deeds inspired by hate are not duties, whatever pain and self-sacrifice they may involve."
"Life and hope for the world are to be found only in the deeds of love."
"What we shall desire for individuals is now clear: strong creative impulses, overpowering and absorbing the instinct of possession."
"What we shall desire for individuals is now clear: reverence for others; respect for the fundamental creative impulse in ourselves."
"Life will realize its best possibilities if it has three things: strong creative impulses, weak possessive impulses, and reverence for others."
"Political and social institutions are to be judged by the good or harm that they do to individuals."
"Institutions, especially economic systems, have a profound influence in molding the characters of people; they may encourage adventure and hope, or timidity and the pursuit of safety."
"Political ideals must be based upon ideals for the individual life."
"The aim of politics should be to make the lives of individuals as good as possible."  
"There is nothing for the politician to consider outside or above the various men, women, and children who compose the world."
"The problem of politics is to adjust the relations of human beings in such a way that each severally may have as much of good in his existence as possible."
"In our economic system, every increase in productivity enables employers to dismiss some of their employees, and to cause destitution."
"In a better economic system than ours, an increase in productivity would produce only an increase of wages or a diminution in the hours of work without any corresponding diminution of wages."
"Our economic system is topsy turvy. It makes the interest of the individual conflict with the interest of the community in a thousand ways in which no such conflict ought to exist."
"Our economic system is topsy turvy. Under a better system the benefits of free trade and the evils of tariffs would be obvious to all."
"The progress of science is a matter of equal concern to the whole civilized world."
"The whole world of art and literature and learning is international; what is done in one country is not done for that country, but for mankind."
"All our economic problems, all the questions of securing the rights of labor, all the hopes of freedom at home and humanity abroad, rest upon the creation of international good-will."
"So long as hatred, suspicion, and fear dominate the feelings of people toward each other, we cannot hope to escape from the tyranny of violence and brute force."
"People must learn to be conscious of the common interests of humanity in which all are at one, rather than of those supposed interests in which the nations are divided."
"It is not necessary, or even desirable, to obliterate the differences of manners and custom and tradition between different nations."
"The patriot does not desire for their own country things which can only be acquired at the expense of others, but rather those things in which
the excellence of any one country is to the advantage of all the world."
"The patriot wants their own country to be great in the arts of peace, to be eminent in thought and science, to be magnanimous and just and
generous."
"Good political institutions weaken the impulse toward force and domination by increasing the opportunities for the creative impulses."
"Good political institutions weaken the impulse toward force and domination by shaping education."
"Good political institutions weaken the impulse toward force and domination by diminishing the outlets for the possessive instincts."
"Autonomy, both for districts and for organizations, would leave fewer occasions when governments were called upon to make decisions as to other people's
concerns."
"The abolition of capitalism and the wage system would remove the chief incentive to fear and greed, those correlative passions by which all free life is choked and gagged."
"Few people seem to realize how many of the evils from which we suffer are wholly unnecessary, and that they could be abolished by a united effort within a few years.""Modern capitalism forces the wrong decision of these alternatives upon all who are not heroic or exceptionally fortunate." 
"Our impulses are molded, partly by native disposition, partly by opportunity and environment, especially early environment." 
"Preaching can do very little to change impulses, though it can lead us to restrain the direct expression of them, so that the impulses go underground and come to the surface again in some contorted form." 
"At present our institutions rest upon two things: property and power." 
"Both property and power are very unjustly distributed; both, in the actual world, are of great importance to the happiness of the individual." 
"Both property and power are possessive goods; yet without them many of the goods in which all might share are hard to acquire as things are now." 
"Without property, a person has no freedom, and no security for the necessities of a tolerable life; without power, he has no opportunity for initiative." 
"If people are to have free play for their creative impulses, they must be liberated from sordid cares by a certain measure of security."
"If people are to have free play for their creative impulses, they must have a sufficient share of power to be able to exercise initiative as regards the course and conditions of their lives." 
"Few people can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a world which is wholly built on competition."
"Few people can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a world where the great majority would fall into utter destitution if they became careless as to the acquisition of material goods."
"Few people can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a world where honor and power and respect are given to wealth rather than to wisdom."
"Few people can succeed in being creative rather than possessive in a world where the law embodies and consecrates the injustice of those who have toward those who have not." 
"Men combine in groups to attain more strength in the scramble for material goods, and loyalty to the group spreads a halo of quasi-idealism round the central impulse of greed." 
"The inspiration and outcome of a reforming movement ought to be freedom and a generous spirit, not niggling restrictions and regulations." 
"The present economic system concentrates initiative in the hands of a small number of very rich men." 
"Those who are not capitalists have, almost always, very little choice as to their activities when once they have selected a trade or profession." 
"Those who are not capitalists are not part of the power that moves the mechanism, but only a passive portion of the machinery." 
"Despite political democracy, there is still an extraordinary degree of difference in the power of self-direction belonging to a capitalist and to a person who has to earn their living." 
"Economic affairs touch people's lives, at most times, much more intimately than political questions." 
"At present the person who has no capital usually has to sell themself to some large organization, such as a railway company, for example." 
"At present the person who has no capital has no voice in management, and no liberty in politics except what their trade-union can secure." 
"A majority of journalists write for newspapers whose politics they disagree with; only a person of wealth can own a large newspaper." 
"Only an accident can enable the point of view or the interests of those who are not wealthy to find expression in a newspaper."
"If a majority in every civilized country so desired, we could, within twenty years, abolish all abject poverty; we could fill the world with beauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace."
"If a majority in every civilized country so desired, we could, within twenty years, abolish half the illness in the world; we could fill the world with beauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace."
"If a majority in every civilized country so desired, we could abolish the economic slavery which binds down nine tenths of our population; we could fill the world with beauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace."
"Every group sufficiently well-marked to constitute a political entity ought to be autonomous in regard to internal matters, but not in regard to those that directly affect the outside world."
"The patriot wants their country to help mankind on the way toward that better world of liberty and international concord which must be
realized if any happiness is to be left to humanity." 
"We do not want to lay down a pattern or type to which men of all sorts are to be made by some means or another to approximate.  This is the ideal of the
impatient administrator."  
"It is not one ideal for all people, but a separate ideal for each separate person, that has to be realized if possible."
"Every person has it in their being to develop into something good or bad: there is a best possible for them, and a worst possible."
"Circumstances will determine whether a person's capacities for good are developed or crushed, and whether their bad impulses are strengthened or diverted into better channels."
"The food and clothing of one person is not the food and clothing of another; if the supply is insufficient, what one person has is obtained at the expense of some other person."
"If one person knows a science, that does not prevent others from knowing it; on the contrary, it helps them to acquire the knowledge."
"If one person is a great artist or poet, that does not prevent others from painting pictures or writing poems, but helps to create the atmosphere in which such things are possible."
"If one person is full of good-will toward others, that does not mean that there is less good-will to be shared among the rest; the more good-will one person has, the more they are likely to create among others."
"The best life aims at minimizing the possessive impulses, which want to acquire or retain private goods that cannot be shared; these center in the
impulse of property."
"The best life aims at maximizing the creative impulses, which aim at making available for use the kind of goods in which there is no privacy and no possession."
"The habit of mind engendered by following the possessive impulses is a bad one; it leads to competition, envy, domination, cruelty, and almost all the moral evils that infest the world."
"Material possessions can be taken by force and enjoyed by the robber. Spiritual possessions cannot be taken in this way."
"You may kill an artist or a thinker, but you cannot acquire their art or their thought."
"You may put a person to death because he loves their fellow-men, but you will not by so doing acquire the love which made their happiness."
"The people who believe in force are the ones whose thoughts and desires are preoccupied with material goods."
